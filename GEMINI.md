# Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website for KN Rishab Puranika, an Information Science & Engineering student. It showcases his skills, projects, education, and contact information.

The application is a modern, single-page website built with **React** and **TypeScript**, and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It is a static site with all content currently hardcoded within the React components. The project is built using **Vite**.

The portfolio is organized into the following sections:
-   **Hero:** A brief introduction.
-   **About:** A more detailed description of his background and interests.
-   **Skills:** A list of technical and soft skills.
-   **Projects:** A showcase of his recent work and open-source contributions.
-   **Education:** Details about his academic background and certifications.
-   **Contact:** Contact information and links to social media profiles.

# Building and Running

The following commands are available to build, run, and test the project:

-   **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
-   **`npm run build`**: Builds the application for production.
-   **`npm run lint`**: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
-   **`npm run preview`**: Serves the production build locally for preview.
-   **`npm run typecheck`**: Performs a static type check using TypeScript.

# Development Conventions

-   **Styling:** The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Utility classes are used directly in the JSX of the components.
-   **Components:** The application is structured into reusable components located in the `src/components` directory.
-   **Linting:** The project uses **ESLint** for code quality and consistency. The configuration is in the `eslint.config.js` file.
-   **Type Checking:** **TypeScript** is used for static type checking. The configuration is in the `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.app.json` files.
